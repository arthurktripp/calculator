Calculator is a project for The Odin Project, Web Development 101. As expected, the logic will be handled by JavaScript, which will interact with the HTML and CSS files that provide a user interface.

In addition to functionality, I intend to add some visual feedback, triggered by mouseclicks or keystrokes.
