Calculator is a project for The Odin Project, Web Development 101. As expected, the logic will be handled by JavaScript, which will interact with the HTML and CSS files that provide a user interface.

In addition to functionality, I intend to add some visual feedback, triggered by mouseclicks or keystrokes.

Some known bugs:
    1) NaN displays when beginning a third operand with a decimal. This does not break the calculater.
    2) When using a series of operators, the second and subsequent operators are applied and calculated before choosing another operand. Breaks until clear button used.

Future Features to consider:
    1) A negative key, that functions for both the displayed answer, or the current operand, as appropriate.
    2) Visual feedback when using the keyboard
